# Robotics Learning App
 - The app will take images and other sensory data.
 - Then process the data into instructions via reinforcement learning and adaptive behaviour.
 - Through trial and error, goal oriented and imitation learning.
 - The Robot receiving intstructions will receive instructions via an optimal policy.
 - Through constant sweeps of the policy and value space we can obtain an optimal policy.
 - The problem gets more interesting in multi-goal/instruction continuous environments.

## Technology
The application will be built in native Android (Java/Kotlin) and utilize as little libraries
for accurate readings and optimizations.
